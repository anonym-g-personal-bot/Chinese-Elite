Jim: I haven't had a call yet.  
Annie: Who from?  
Jim: Our new Prime Minister, of course. Who do you think?  
Annie: Well, what do you expect? The car's only just got back from the Palace. I saw it on the news.  
Jim: Any moment now, then.  
Annie: So who was on the phone?  
Jim: Frank Wiesel. He's coming right over.  
Annie: Why doesn't he just move in?  
Jim: Annie, sometimes I don't understand you. He's my political adviser. I depend on him more than anyone.  
Annie: Why don't you marry him?  
Jim: Darling, you do over-react to everything, so.  
Jim: Here we are!  
Jim: Jim Hacker... yes. Oh, it's you. Yes, was a good party, wasn't it? Yes, I've got a bit of a headache, too... Look, do you mind if I ring you back. I'm waiting for a rather important call... yes, bye bye.  
Jim: Alderman Spottiswood. I wish people wouldn't kept ring me up to congratulate me. Don't they realise that I'm waiting for the call.  
Annie: It sounds as if you're about to enter the Ministry.  
Jim: Yes, but which Ministry, that's the whole point.  
Annie: It was a joke!  
Jim: I see. Are you very tense?  
Annie: No, no, I'm not tense. I'm just a politician's wife, I'm not allowed to have feelings. A happy carefree politician's wife.  
Jim: What are you looking for?  
Annie: A cigarette. I can't find any.  
Jim: Try the cigarette box.  
Annie: It's empty.  
Jim: Take a librium.  
Annie: I can't find the librium, that's why I'm looking for a cigarette.  
Annie: Jim, I've had it. Would you pop out and get some?  
Jim: Sorry, love, daren't leave the phone.  
Annie: Look, if the PM wants you to be in the stupid cabinet, the PM will phone back if you're out. Or you can phone back.  
Jim: Darling, the whole point is, that I ran the campaign against the PM for the leadership. If I'm out, well, who knows.  
Annie: I could take a message.  
Jim: There it is. Hello... yes, speaking... Oh, it's you, Michael... No, I haven't had a call, have you had a call? Bill's had a call? What's he got? Europe? Bill's got Europe.  
Annie: Lucky Europe. I didn't know Bill could speak French?  
Jim: He can hardly speak English. 
Jim: Yeah. I'll call you back if I hear anything. Right... Bye.  
Jim: Fingers crossed. Hello... Yes, speaking... The Gas Board. Good Lord man, that was weeks ago. Yeah. Well, would you mind, I'm waiting for a rather important call... Look, Mr Franklin, there happened to be a general election yesterday... You voted for the otherside, did you? How on earth did you manage to get to the polling booth on the right day? With two assistants, three returns for spare parts? Look, Mr. Franklin... Now, Frankly, Franklin, I don't care if the whole central heating system collapses in ruins. I have got to get off this phone, goodbye.  
Annie: They won't come now.  
Jim: If the PM gives me Consumer Affairs, they'll come.  
Jim: Hello? Hello? Hello?  
Annie: Darling, that was the front doorbell. It'll be Frank.  
Frank: Did you know Martin's got the Foreign Office.  
Jim: Has he?  
Frank: Jack's got Health and Fred's got Energy.  
Annie: Has anyone got Brains?  
Jim: What? Do you mean Education?  
Annie: No, I know what I mean. 
Jim: Well, what's left? What have I got?  
Annie: Rhythm?  
Jim: Frank, I have heard absolutely nothing, not that it's surprising. My whole career is going down the drain and up the spout because the Prime Minister of England is totally unable to reach me on the electric telephone.  
Jim: You get it, would you, darling.  
Annie: Hello.  
BBC Reporter: Hello, this is the BBC. We were wondering if Mr. Hacker would like to be interviewed on the PM program this afternoon?  
Annie: PM?  
Jim: PM?  
Jim: Hello, yes, Jim Hacker here... Yes, I...  
BBC Reporter: Are you available this afternoon?  
Jim: Yes. Any time you like. Any time you...  
BBC Reporter: We were wondering if perhaps we could interview you?  
Jim: Yes, I've been hoping you'd call.  
BBC Reporter: Tell me, what job do you think you're likely to get?  
Jim: I beg your pardon?  
BBC Reporter: Tell me, what job do you think you're likely to get?  
Jim: Hardly for me to say, isn't it? That's for you to tell me.  
BBC Reporter: What?  
Jim: What? I mean, well, it's not up to me to say. I mean, that's for the PM to say. I mean, you're the PM's office... Oh, I see. The BBC PM office! How silly, what a silly mistake. Yes... yes. Good bye.  
Annie: Well, I did try and tell you.  
Jim: You answer the bloody thing.  
Annie: Hello... Mrs. Hacker speaking. Oh, congratulations, Prime Minister. It's Annie here.  
Jim: Give me that phone.  
Annie: Yes--  
Jim: Hello... Yes... Prime Minister. Yes, of course... Yes, I... Righto. I'll be on the next train.

Narrator: Top tip for The Department of Administrative Affairs is Jim Hacker.  
Narrator: Kenneth, isn't he on the young side for a Cabinet post?  
Kenneth: Yes, well, he's in his late forties. But it's certainly a jump up for him. On the other hand, this department's been a bit of a political graveyard recently.  
...
Narrator: A further group of Cabinet appointments has now been announced from Number Ten. The post of the Ministry of Administrative Affairs goes to Jim Hacker, the former Shadow Minister for Agriculture.

Bernard: Good afternoon, Minister.  
Jim: Good afternoon.  
Bernard: Bernard Wooley, Principal Private Secretary.  
Jim: How do you do?  
Bernard: This is Mr. Lloyd Pritchard, Assistant Private Secretary.  
Lloyd: Minister.  
Jim: How do you do?  
Jim: This is my political adviser...  
Bernard: Oh yes, of course, Mr. Weasel.  
Frank: Wiesel.  
Bernard: I was the Minister's Principal Private Secretary but, of course, that was in the last government, Minister. However if you...  
Jim: Well, no, no, no. I'm sure you'll be just the thing.  
Bernard: Thank you, Minister, how kind.  
Jim: Where are we all going to?  
Bernard: You are going to your office, Minister.  
Jim: What about Frank? Where's Frank?  
Bernard: He's being taken care of, Minister. 
Lloyd: Would you wait here, sir?  
Frank: But this is the Waiting Room.  
Lloyd: Precisely, sir.  
Frank: But I'm Jim Hacker's special adviser.  
Lloyd: Well, the Minister now has a whole department to advise him, sir.  
Frank: Look, he needs me.  
Lloyd: Of course he does, sir. But until the Minister sends for you, would you be so good just to wait.

Bernard: Sherry, Minister?  
Jim: Jim.  
Bernard: Gin?  
Jim: No, no, Jim, Jim. Call me Jim.  
Bernard: Well, I think if it's all the same to you, I would prefer to call you Minister, Minister.  
Jim: Minister, Minister? Quite, quite. I see what you mean. Does that mean I have to call you Private Secretary, Private Secretary?  
Bernard: No. Do call me Bernard.  
Jim: Thank you, Bernard.  
Bernard: You're most welcome, Minister.  
Jim: Cheers, Bernard.  
Bernard: Your health, Minister.  
Jim: Well what now?  
Bernard: Minister, allow me to present Sir Humphrey Appleby, Permanent Under-Secretary of State and Head of the D.A.A.  
Jim: Hello, Sir Humphrey.  
Humphrey: Hello, and welcome.  
Jim: Thank you, Sir Humphrey.  
Bernard: I believe you know each other.  
Humphrey: Yes, we did cross swords when the Minister gave me a grilling over the Estimates in the Public Accounts Committee, last year.  
Jim: I wouldn't say that.  
Humphrey: Well, you came up with all the questions I hope nobody would ask.  
Jim: Well, opposition's about asking awkward questions.  
Humphrey: And Government's about not answering them.  
Jim: Well, you answered all mine, anyway.  
Humphrey: I'm glad you thought so, Minister. Good luck.  
Jim: Now, who else is in this Department?  
Humphrey: Well, briefly sir, I am the Permanent Under-Secretary of the State known as the Permanent Secretary. Wolley here is your Principal Private Secretary. I too have a Principal Private Secretary, and he is the Principal Private Secretary to the Permanent Secretary. Directly responsible to me are 10 Deputy Secretaries, 87 Under-Secretaries, and 219 Assistant Secretaries. Directly Responsible to the Principal Private Secretary are plain Private Secretaries. And the Prime Minister will be appointing two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries, and you will appointing your own Parliamentary Private Secretary.
Jim: Can they all type?
Humphrey: None of us can type, Minister. Mrs. McKay types. She is the Secretary.
Jim: Pity, we could have opened an agency.
Humphrey: Very droll, sir.
Bernard: Yes, very very amusing, sir.
Jim: Yeah. I suppose they all say that, do they?
Humphrey: Certainly not, Minister. Not quite all.
Jim: Right, now then, to business.
Jim: Now, you'll have to forgive me if I'm a bit blunt, but that's the sort of chap I am... Frankly, this depart...
Jim: Yeah. I don't care for this chair's a bit much.
Bernard: We can change it, Minister.
Jim: Can you?
Humphrey: We can change anything, Minister. The furniture, decor, office routine... Your wish is our command.
Jim: In that case, I'd like a new chair. I hate swivel chairs.
Bernard: It used to be said there are two kinds of chairs to go with two kinds of Minister. One sort folds up instantly, the other sort goes round and round in circles.
Jim: Now then, gentlemen, frankly this Department has got to cut a great swathe through all this stuffy Whitehall bureaucracy. We want a new broom. We're going to throw open the windows, let in a bit of fresh air, cut through all the red tape, streamline this creaking old bureaucratic machine.
Humphrey: You mean a clean sweep, Minister?
Jim: That's it. A clean sweep. Far too many people just sitting behind desks.
Jim: Not like us, of course.
Jim: But we've got to get rid of all those people just making work for each other.
Humphrey: Get rid of them?
Jim: Yes.
Humphrey: I think you mean "Redeploy them", sir.
Jim: Yeah. Yes. Good Lord, no, I don't mean put them out of work. No, no. Open Government, that's what my party believes in, that was the main plank of our manifesto. Taking the nation into our confidence. Now how does that strike you?
Jim: Do sit down.
Humphrey: May I? In fact, just as you said in the House on May 2nd last year, and again on November 23rd, and in your Observer article, and in your Daily Mail interview, and as your manifesto made clear.
Jim: You know about that?
Humphrey: I'd like you to have a look at these proposals, Minister. They outline the ways in which this policy could be implemented, and contain draft proposals for a white paper for your approval. We thought the white paper might be called "Open Government".
Jim: You mean it's all been...
Humphrey: All been taken care of, Minister.
Jim: Who did all this?
Humphrey: The creaking old bureaucratic machine. No, quite seriously. We are fully seized of the need for reform. And we have taken it on board.
Jim: I say, I'm rather surprised. I expected to have to fight you all the way along the line with this.
Humphrey: People do have funny ideas about the Civil Service. We're just here to help you formulate and implement your policies.
Jim: Proposals for shortening approval procedures in planning appeals?
Humphrey: Hansard Volume 497, page 1102, Column B. Quote "Mr. Hacker: Is the Minister aware that planning procedures make building a bungalow in the 20th century slower than building a cathedral in the 12th century? Opposition laughter and Government cries of shame".
Jim: Yeah. They didn't actually cry shame.
Humphrey: Quite so, Minister.
Jim: Well, I think that's it then?
Bernard: There are one or two more things, Minister.
Jim: What things?
Bernard: Yes. If you would just like to check your diary for next week, Minister.
Jim: My diary? You didn't know I was coming. You didn't even know who'd win the election.
Bernard: We knew there'd be a Minister, Minister.
Jim: Don't start that again.
Bernard: I'm sorry, even though we didn't know it would be you.
Humphrey: Yes, you see, Her Majesty does like the business of government to continue even when there are no politicians around.
Jim: Bit difficult surely?
Humphrey: Yes... and no.
Bernard: It's gonna be quite a busy week, Minister. Nine cabinet committees, the Annual dinner of the Law Institute on Monday at 8:00, for which you will have to make a speech. Deputation from the British Computer Association, 10:30 Tuesday morning. Opening the National Union of Public Employers annual meeting at 11:00 on Wednesday, which you will have to make another speech...
Jim: Wait, wait, wait a minute... What about all the other things I have to do?
Bernard: What other things, Minister?
Jim: Well, I'm on four policy committees for the party for a start.
Humphrey: Well, I'm sure you won't want to be putting party before country, Minister.
Jim: No, no, of course not. No.
Bernard: I'll just fetch your boxes, Minister.
Jim: Boxes? Already.
Humphrey: Yes, you see. We did manage to keep the last Minister supplied with work throughout the campaign, but I fear... well, it's not for me to criticise...
Jim: What do you mean?
Humphrey: Well, it's a harsh thing to say about anyone. But, some of the boxes actually came back with the work not done.
Bernard: If you could complete the first four by Saturday evening, your driver could collect them and deliver the other two.
Jim: Villa's at home to Liverpool. And I've got a surgery in my constituency on Saturday.
Humphrey: I suppose we could minimise the paper work, so that you need only take the major policy decisions.
Jim: No, no, no. No. No. I will take all the decisions round here. Now then, what time shall I come in on Monday?
Bernard: You'll catch the 7:45 train from New Street, Minister, and your driver meet you at Euston, Platform 7.
Jim: Fine.
Bernard: If I could just put in these draft proposals. And here, and this is your key, Minister.
Frank: Get out of my way. I've had enough of this.
Lloyd: You can't go in there.
Frank: Just try and stop me.
Frank: Jim, what is going on?
Jim: Frank, where have you been?
Frank: Stuck in the waiting room.
Bernard: Do you mind? We are in a private conference with the minister.
Frank: Then I should be here, too.
Bernard: Yeah, why is that?
Jim: Now, calm... calm down, Frank. Humphrey, Frank has got to have an office of his own in the department.
Humphrey: Certainly, Minister, if you insist.
Jim: I do insist.
Humphrey: Well, I do think we have some spare office space in Walthamstow. Don't we, Bernard?
Frank: Walthamstow?
Humphrey: Yes, it's surprising, isn't it? The Government owns property all over London.
Frank: I don't want to be in Walthamstow.
Bernard: It's in a very nice part in Walthamstow.
Humphrey: Walthamstow's a very nice place, so I gather.
Frank: I need an office here in this building.
Humphrey: Why's that?
Jim: Yes, I agree with Frank.
Humphrey: Well, in that case, Bernard, we must find an office here for Mr. Weasel.
Frank: Wiesel.
Jim: And I want copies of all papers that come to me go to Frank.
Humphrey: All?
Jim: All.
Humphrey: It shall be done.
Humphrey: All the appropriate papers.

Arnold: How's your new Minister, Humphrey?
Humphrey: Well, learning the rules very quickly for a newboy. How's your new Cabinet?
Arnold: No problem. Can hardly tell the difference from the last one.
Humphrey: Arnold, I hear the American Ambassador's been spending a lot of time with the PM these last few days.
Arnold: Yes.
Humphrey: Defence or trade?
Arnold: Both.
Humphrey: The aerospace systems contract?
Arnold: Shh... Don't want the cabinet to hear about it yet.
Humphrey: This, aerospace thingumy would be rather a coup for the PM, wouldn't it?
Arnold: Yes, of course, it's been in the pipeline for months, but the new PM will take the credit.
Humphrey: So...
Bernard: Sorry to intrude, Sir Arnold, Sir Humphrey, if you could just OK the redraft for the Minister's winding-up speech, I can get it straight down to the House.
Humphrey: Yes, of course.
Humphrey: You like to join us?
Bernard: Thank you, Sir Humphrey, so long as I'm not too long.
Humphrey: Get yourself a cup of coffee.
Humphrey: So it would be rather an embarrassment to the PM, wouldn't it? If a hypothetical Minister were to rock the Anglo-American boat?
Arnold: Grave embarrassment.
Humphrey: How grave?
Arnold: Man overboard, I should think.
Humphrey: Enough to cut short a promising new Ministerial career?
Arnold: No question.
Humphrey: Pull up a chair, Bernard... And tell us what you think of our new Minister.
Bernard: Well, absolutely fine.
Humphrey: Yes, we'll have him house-trained in no time. He swallowed the whole diary in one gulp, and I gather he did his boxes like a lamb last Saturday and Sunday?
Bernard: Yes. Yes he did.
Humphrey: Long as we can head him off this Open Government nonsense.
Bernard: But I thought we were calling the White Paper "Open Government".
Humphrey: Yes, well, always dispose of the difficult bit in the title. Does less harm there than in the text.
Arnold: It's the Law of Inverse Relevance. The less you intend to do about something, the more you have to keep talking about it.
Bernard: But, what's wrong with open government? I mean, why shouldn't the public know more about what's going on?
Arnold: Are you serious?
Bernard: Well, yes, sir, I mean it's the Minister's policy, after all.
Arnold: My dear boy, it's a contradiction in terms. You can be open or you can have government.
Bernard: But surely the citizens of a democracy have a right to know.
Humphrey: No. They have a right to be ignorant. Knowledge only means complicity and guilt. Ignorance has a certain dignity.
Bernard: But if the Minister wants open government...
Humphrey: You don't just give people what they want, if it's not good for them. Do you give brandy to an alcoholic?
Arnold: If people don't know what you are doing, they don't know what you are doing wrong.
Bernard: Well, I'm... I'm sorry, Sir Humphrey, I am the Minister's Private Secretary, and if that's what he wants...
Humphrey: My dear fellow, you will not be serving your minister by helping him to make a fool of himself. Look at the Ministers we've had. Every one of them would have been a laughing stock in three months had it not been for the most rigid and impenetrable secrecy about what they were up to.
Bernard: What do you propose to do about it?
Humphrey: Can you keep a secret?
Bernard: Of course.
Humphrey: --So can I. 
Humphrey: Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.
Bernard: Well, I'd... better be getting this back to the Minister.

---

Humphrey: Martin. Has the weasel had a copy of the invoice for the new American addressing machines?
Martin: No, Sir Humphrey, I thought you said it was sensitive.
Humphrey: So it is. Get it to him today. Oh, and, Martin... let him find it near the bottom of the pile.

---

Frank: Jim, Jim.
Jim: Yeah.
Frank: Look what I've found.
Frank: We've got them. We've got them by the short and curlies.
Jim: What're you talking about?
Frank: We've got Sir Humphrey-Bloody-Appleby and Mr.Toffee-Nosed-Private-Secretary-Snooty-Wolley just where we want them. See this? This innocent-looking piece of paper. --Political dynamite.
Jim: All right. Calm down, Frank. I don't even know what are you talking about?
Frank: This is an invoice for 1,000 computer video display terminals. At 10,000 pounds each, that's ten million pounds.
Jim: So?
Frank: Made by the Pittsburgh Manufacturing Corporation Inc., 
Jim: Imported... from America?
Frank: I know.
Jim: But we make computer peripherals in this country... In my constituency!
Frank: I know!
Jim: What about unemployment?
Frank: I know!
Jim: This must be stopped.
Bernard: Sir Humphrey to see... Sorry, Minister.
Jim: No. No, no, come in. As a matter of fact, I want to see you both, come on.
Jim: Sir Humphrey, take a seat.
Humphrey: Thank you, Minister.
Jim: Now then, Frank here has just discovered this contract for the import of ten million pound's worth of video display terminals, from America.
Humphrey: May I see? Oh yes. For the whole Civil Service in Whitehall.
Jim: But they're not British.
Humphrey: That is unfortunately true.
Jim: But we make these machines in this country.
Humphrey: Not of the same quality.
Jim: Better quality. They're made in my constituency.
Humphrey: We were advised...
Jim: Humphrey, this contract must be stopped.
Humphrey: Well, now, I'm afraid that's beyond my power, Minister. This could only be cancelled by the Treasury.
Frank: Why's that?
Humphrey: Well, would be a major policy change for the Civil Service to cancel contracts freely entered into, especially with overseas suppliers. Of course, you'd like to take it up with the Cabinet.
Jim: How am I to face my constituency party?
Humphrey: Why need they know? Why need anybody know? We can see that it never gets out.
Frank: Open Government.
Jim: That's right. Open Government.
Frank: If the order can't be cancelled, it must be published.
Jim: That's right. It must be published.
Humphrey: Why?
Jim: Well I... Why?
Frank: The manifesto. Also it will make your predecessor look like a traitor.
Jim: There you are, two unanswerable reasons.
Humphrey: Yes, but...
Frank: You didn't bargain for this, did you?
Humphrey: But surely you're not suggesting that the Minister should make a positive reference to this confidential transaction in a speech?
Frank: Speech. That's it.
Frank: Jim, what about that speech you're supposed to deliver to the Union of Office Employees?
Jim: That's right, Frank. I'll tell them about this scandalous contract. And we'll release it to the press today.
Frank: There. Who's running the country now?
Humphrey: Well... yes.
Jim: You object, Humphrey?
Humphrey: Well, I do think it might be regrettable, sir, if we were to upset the Americans.
Jim: The Americans. It's about time they were jolted out of their commercial complacency. It's time we start to thinking of the British poor, not the American rich!
Frank: Right!
Humphrey: Well, Minister, if that is your express wish, the Department will back you, up to the hilt.
Jim: That is my express wish.
Bernard: Well then, I'd better circulate the speech to the relevant departments for clearance.
Jim: Clearance? It got nothing to do with any other department.
Humphrey: But, surely, Open Government demands that we should include our colleagues, as well as our friends in Fleet Street.
Jim: Oh yes, that's fair enough.
Frank: Well, I'm not sure.
Jim: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. And Humphrey...
Humphrey: Minister.
Jim: See that that goes straight to the press, won't you?
Humphrey: We shall obviously serve your best interests.
Jim: Thank you.
Jim: Now then... Let me see. Open Government. As you know, we've made a pledge to the people about open government. So let's have some. I have discovered that only last month, the previous government signed a contract to import 10 million pounds worth of office equipment for use by the Civil Service...
Frank: Bureaucracy!
Jim: Used by the Civil Service bureaucracy. So, we are being fobbed off with second rate American junk by smart aleck salesmen from Pittsburgh while British factories stand empty and British workmen queue up for the dole.
Bernard: Unemployment benefit.
Jim: The dole, Bernard.
Jim: Much as I personally value the friendship of our great cousins from across the sea.

---

Bernard: Excuse me Minister, something's come up.
Jim: Yes?
Bernard: A minute from the Prime Minister's Office.
Jim: I'm pretty busy.
Bernard: Well, I do think you ought to read this, Minister.
Jim: Well, what does it say?
Bernard: To inform you that the PM is planning a visit to Washington next month and is anxious of the visit will result in a valuable Anglo-American defence trade agreement. The importance of obtaining this agreement cannot be overestimated.
Jim: Fine.
Jim: My God, has my speech gone to the press?
Bernard: Well, I presume so, Minister, as you requested.
Humphrey: Minister, I'm sorry to burst in like this, but all hell's just broken loose at Number Ten. Apparently, they've just seen your speech, they're asking why we didn't obtain clearance.
Jim: What did you say?
Humphrey: Well, I said we believe in open government. But it seemed to make things worse. The PM wants to see you in the House, right away.
Jim: What's going to happen?
Humphrey: The Prime Minister giveth and the Prime Minister taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Prime Minister.

---

Jim: Hello, Vic... You know Sir Humphrey Appleby? Vic Gould, our Chief Whip.
Vic: You really are a pain in the ass, aren't you? The PM's going up the wall. Hitting the roof. You can't go around making speeches like that.
Jim: Well, I don't...
Frank: It's Open Government.
Vic: Shut up, Weasel. Who's asking you?
Frank: Wiesel!
Jim: But he's right, Open Government, I mean, it was the main plank in our manifesto. I mean, the PM believes in that too.
Vic: Open, yes. But not gaping. In politics you have to learn say things with tact and finesse, you berk! And when to say nothing at all. How long have you been a Minister?
Jim: Week and half.
Vic: I think you may have find yourself a place in the Guinness book of records. I can see the headlines already. "Cabinet split on U.S. trade." "Hacker leads revolt against Prime Minister." That's what you want, is it?
Humphrey: Sir Arnold, what news?
Arnold: That speech is causing the Prime Minister some distress. Has it definitely been released to the press?
Humphrey: Well, the Minister gave express instructions for noon. Isn't that right? 
Arnold: I'm appalled at you, Humphrey. How could you let the Minister put himself in this position without going through the proper channels?
Humphrey: Well the Minister and I believe in open government. We want to open the windows and let in a bit of fresh air. Isn't that right, Minister?
Arnold: Well, Minister, it's good party stuff, but it puts the Prime Minister in a very difficult situation, personally.
Jim: What about our commitment to Open Government?
Arnold: This seems to be the closed season for open government. 
Humphrey: Do you want to... you want to give thought to a draft letter of resignation, Minister? I mean, just in case...
Jim: Couldn't we hush it up?
Humphrey: Hush it up?
Jim: Yes, hush it up.
Humphrey: You mean... suppress it?
Jim: Yes, I suppose I do.
Humphrey: I see. You mean that within the framework of the guidelines about open government that you have laid down, you're suggesting that we should adopt a more flexible posture?
Jim: Do I? Oh yes. Yes.
Bernard: Excuse me, Minister, about the press release...
Jim: Yeah.
Bernard: There appears to be a development which could precipitate a reappraisal of our position. Apparently we fail to rescind the interdepartmental clearance procedure. The supplementary stop order came into effect.
Jim: Really?
Bernard: So, it's all right, Minister, your speech hasn't gone to the press. It's only gone to the Prime Minister's Private Office and the Duty Officer have had no instructions to pass it out without clearance from the PM and the Foreign Office, see, American reference, you see.
Jim: But how come?
Humphrey: The fault is entirely mine, Minister. The procedure for holding up press releases dates back to before era of open government, and I unaccountably omitted to rescind it. I do hope you'll forgive this lapse.
Jim: Well, yes, of course. That's quite all right, Humphrey. Quite all right.
Humphrey: Thank you, Minister.
Jim: After all, we all make mistakes.
Humphrey: Yes, Minister.
