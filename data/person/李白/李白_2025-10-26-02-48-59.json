          "en": "A Tang dynasty poet and official, known as the 'Poet Immortal.' His poetry is characterized by its ethereal and unrestrained style, filled with romanticism. His ancestry is disputed, with theories suggesting he was a Han Chinese from Shu, a Han Chinese from the Western Regions, or of non-Han origin from the Western Regions. He was summoned by Emperor Xuanzong to serve as a Hanlin Academy attendant but later left his post due to political intrigue. During the An Lushan Rebellion, he joined the staff of the Prince of Yong, Li Lin, and was exiled to Yelang after the prince's defeat, but was pardoned en route. His poetry has had a profound influence on later generations."
